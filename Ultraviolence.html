              That stood for deadly nightshade
            </p>
            <p>
              'Cause I was filled with poison
            </p>
            <p>
              But blessed with beauty and rage

            <p>
              Jim told me that
            </p>
            <p>
              He hit me and it felt like a kiss

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="meaning">Based off of this first verse DN stands for deadly nightshade which I looked up is a poisonous plant.
            So this might be a metaphor implying that Lana or whoever she is talking about in the song is beautiful and dangerous/angry.
            <p>
              The Jim line might be her experience with a boyfriend or maybe a friends experience with someone who was abusive.
              It also seems she is reflecting on this toxic relationship and it seems like she is longing for the past which doesnt make sense to me since it seems like she was emotionally and physically manipulated.

          <div class="lyric">With his ultraviolence
            <p>
              Ultraviolence
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultraviolence
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultraviolence
            </p>
            <p>
              I can hear sirens, sirens
            </p>
            <p>
              He hit me and it felt like a kiss
            </p>
            <p>
              I can hear violins, violins
            </p>
            <p>
              Give me all of that ultraviolence
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="meaning">I wonder if ultraviolence means something else but this is what I interpret it as her love being extremely intense and painful.
            <p>
              The sirens i think has two meanings/metaphors which could be sirens from an ambulance or police car.
              The ambulance meaning could be that she is hurt and needs help or the police car meaning could be that she is in trouble and needs to be rescued.
              The second one could be sirens from greek mythology which they are know for luring sailors to their death with their voices.
              This could mean that she is being lured into a toxic relationship and she knows it (at least I hope she knows) but she still wants to be in it.
              Which is kind of messed up and its pissing me off.
            </p>
            <p>
              The violins could represent the beauty and love of the relationship.
              The violins and the sirens might make it seem like she is caught in this cycle of love and violence and can't escape it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "give me all of that ultraviolence" line could mean that she is addicted to the pain and the love and can't get enough of it.
              Which again she goes on about a very toxic relationship and I hope its just a song and not a actual experience she or someone she knows went through.

        <div class="line-meaning">
          <div class="lyric">He used to call me poison
            <p>
              Like I was poison ivy
            </p>
            <p>
              I could've died right then
            </p>
            <p>
              'Cause he was right beside me
            </p>
            <p>
              Jim raised me up
            </p>
            <p>
              He hurt me but it felt like true love
            </p>
            <p>
              Jim taught me that
            </p>
            <p>
              Loving him was never enough
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="meaning">In the poison ivy line it seems to imply that her boyfriend is manipulating her into thinking that she is the problem in the relationship and/or she is "poisoning" everyone around her. (What an emotional manipulative bitch.)
            <p>
              In the next line it seems like she is saying that he was always there for her, but in a way that was harmful. The line 
              "I could've died right then" suggests that she felt a deep emotional pain, but he was there to support her through it, which is a twisted form of love.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next line makes it seem like Jim gave her a sense of purpose kind of like he built her up emotionally probably from a time when she was feeling lost and alone.
              This probably implies that she was dependent on him for her self-worth and identity. Which is why everytime he hurt her it felt like love because that is what she associates love with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lana seemed to realize that not matter how much she loved Jim, it would never be enough to make the relationship work. That messed with her head and made her question her own worth.

              Loving you was really hard
            </p>
            <p>
              We could go back to Woodstock
            </p>
            <p>
              Where they don't know who we are
            </p>

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="meaning">
              Again this is kind of makes it seem like she is embracing the fact she is with him because of his destructive nature.
            <p>
              I'm not really sure about the New York line but it seems like she is saying that they can go back to a time when they were happy and in love.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next line it seems like she was finally admitting that loving him wasn't easy and it was hard on her emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a second when I read the woodtock line i thought it was from Peanuts but it turns out its from a festival in 1969 about peace(I think).
              The Woodstock line seems to imply that they can go back to a time when they were free and happy and no one knew who they were.
              Which is kind of ironic since their relationship is everything but peaceful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think the heaven is on earth line is her saying that she feels like she has found paradise with him, even though it is toxic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The blessed is this union sounds something like a prayer you hear at a wedding for like vows. Ooh maybe its like worshiping him like a god. Nah proabbly not.
            </p>
            <p>
              I honestly dont know what the crying tears of gold line means but I think it might be her saying that she is crying tears of gold as

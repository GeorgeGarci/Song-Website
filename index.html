          <div class="lyric">"He used to call me DN
                              That stood for deadly nightshade
                              'Cause I was filled with poison
                              But blessed with beauty and rage
                              Jim told me that
                              He hit me and it felt like a kiss
                              Jim brought me back
                              Reminded me of when we were kids"</div>
          <div class="meaning">Based off of this first verse DN stands for deadly nightshade which I looked up is a poisonous plant.
            So this might be a metaphor implying that Lana or whoever she is talking about in the song is beautiful and dangerous/angry.
            <p>
              The Jim line might be her experience with a boyfriend or maybe a friends experience with someone who was abusive.
              It also seems she is reflecting on this toxic relationship and it seems like she is longing for the past which doesnt make sense to me since it seems like she was emotionally and physically manipulated.
            </p>

      <!-- Second verse section -->
      <div class="lyrics-section">
        <div class="line-meaning">
          <div class="lyric">"With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence"</div>
          <div class="meaning">I wonder if ultraviolence means something else but this is what I interpret it as her love being extremely intense and painful.
            <p>
              The sirens i think has two meanings/metaphors which could be sirens from an ambulance or police car.
              The ambulance meaning could be that she is hurt and needs help or the police car meaning could be that she is in trouble and needs to be rescued.
              The second one could be sirens from greek mythology which they are know for luring sailors to their death with their voices.
              This could mean that she is being lured into a toxic relationship and she knows it (at least I hope she knows) but she still wants to be in it.
              Which is kind of messed up and its pissing me off.

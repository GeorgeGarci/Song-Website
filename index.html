          <div class="lyric">"He used to call me DN
                              That stood for deadly nightshade
                              'Cause I was filled with poison
                              But blessed with beauty and rage
                              Jim told me that
                              He hit me and it felt like a kiss
                              Jim brought me back
                              Reminded me of when we were kids"</div>
          <div class="meaning">Based off of this first verse DN stands for deadly nightshade which I looked up is a poisonous plant.
            So this might be a metaphor implying that Lana or whoever she is talking about in the song is beautiful and dangerous/angry.
            <p>
              The Jim line might be her experience with a boyfriend or maybe a friends experience with someone who was abusive.
              It also seems she is reflecting on this toxic relationship and it seems like she is longing for the past which doesnt make sense to me since it seems like she was emotionally and physically manipulated.
